    "text": "I am Molly. I’m fourteen. My hobbies are swimming, cooking and skiing. I have got a dog and a cat. We have five family members in our family including me. My mother is a model. She is 180 cm tall. My father is a pilot. He had to arrive from America yesterday, but his flight was canceled and he went to Turkey. My brother is an artist. He can draw well. My sister is a cute girl. She is playing now. I’m older than my sister, so I don’t like playing dolls. I have a lot of dreams. I have never been abroad. I would like to go to Egypt, Japan and China. I’m going to learn Japanese next year.",
